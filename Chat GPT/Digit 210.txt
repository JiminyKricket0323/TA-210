Here are some lyrics for a song about the Star Wars story line:
Verse 1:
A long time ago in a galaxy far,
A battle between the dark and the star,
The Sith Lords they sought to control,
But the Jedi fought to save the soul
Chorus:
Star Wars, the fight for what's right,
Star Wars, the struggle between the light,
Star Wars, the force will guide us through,
Star Wars, the story we all knew
Verse 2:
Anakin Skywalker, the chosen one,
But his fall to the dark side begun,
The empire rose, and the rebels fought,
With the help of the droids they had brought
Chorus:
Star Wars, the fight for what's right,
Star Wars, the struggle between the light,
Star Wars, the force will guide us through,
Star Wars, the story we all knew
Verse 3:
Luke, Leia, and Han Solo too,
They fought for freedom, and the victory was true,
The empire fell, and peace was restored,
The force will live on forevermore
Chorus:
Star Wars, the fight for what's right,
Star Wars, the struggle between the light,
Star Wars, the force will guide us through,
Star Wars, the story we all knew
Outro:
The story may be over, but the legacy lives on,
May the force be with you, until next dawn.
Of course, these lyrics are just a rough draft and the song needs to be set to music and perform before it can become a song. This is just a small example and some artistic liberty was taken to make it rhyme and fit in a song format.
